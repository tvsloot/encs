  "homeCONTENTP1": "I recently moved from the United States to the Czech Republic, and thought that an online repository of vocabulary flashcards would be not only useful in my Czech language studies, but easier to compile on a large scale than physical cards—and eco-friendly to boot.",
  "homeCONTENTP2": "The premise is simple: the flashcards page contains a (soon to be) comprehensive list of flashcards with common vocabulary, which can be filtered by category and interacted with in various ways to aid in memorization.",
  "homeCONTENTP3": "This site is, in essence, a learning tool I have put together for myself and my family, but if others find it useful that’s great too—enjoy! I will continue to add new vocabulary in my free time, and plan to build some interactive learning games down the road, so be sure to check back periodically.",
  "homeSTART": "Get started!"
